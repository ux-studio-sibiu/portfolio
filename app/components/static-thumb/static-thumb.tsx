// Static background's thumbnail: the experiment itself, drawn rather than
// embedded. It is a film-grain generator, so a picture of one — or a whole page
// loaded in an iframe to draw one — says less than the thing running.
//
// The technique is the experiment's own, and it is the reason this costs almost
// nothing to keep on screen:
//
//   CELL   noise is generated into a buffer one pixel per cell and stretched to
//          fill with smoothing off, so a 150px frame is a couple of dozen pixels
//          of work rather than fifteen thousand. The cells being large is the
//          whole look, not a compromise for speed — though it is both.
//   FPS    redrawn at a film rate rather than the screen's. Eight is below the
//          experiment's own 24 on purpose: this is a thumbnail, and at 24 a
//          grain field this coarse reads as flicker rather than as grain.
//
// It only moves while the frame is pointed at or focused; at rest it is a single
// still frame of the same noise. That also settles what the experiment solves
// with an off-screen pause and a hidden-tab pause: nothing is running unless
// someone is looking straight at it.
//
// prefers-reduced-motion is honoured the way the experiment honours it — one
// frame, and it stays there however much it is hovered.
