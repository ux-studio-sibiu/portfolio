// A vertical hairline that is straight and still until the cursor comes within
// REACH of it. Inside that it is dragged around by the cursor's MOVEMENT rather
// than its position: flick sideways and the line is pulled that way, run along
// it and it is wrung into an S behind you. A cursor that stops moving — even
// one parked right on the line — lets it settle straight again.
//
// Two things are asked of whoever renders it:
//
//   surface   the element the cursor is tracked over. Scoped rather than the
//             window so a line that has been slid off-screen is not still being
//             thrown about against a stale rect.
//   a height  an svg is a replaced element: pin top and bottom and its height
//             stays auto, which resolves off the viewBox ratio instead of
//             stretching. Give it a real height or it hangs past the bottom.
//
// Everything else is its own. Placement — where it sits, what is above it,
// whether it shows at all — belongs to the stylesheet that puts it there; the
// width does not, because the svg has to be much wider than the line for it to
// have somewhere to swing, and that width is ROOM below. It is published as
// --room so the two cannot drift apart.
//
// The knobs, px unless said:
//
//   REACH  how close the cursor gets before the line reacts at all
//   PULL   the furthest a sideways flick can drag the line — unrelated to
//          REACH on purpose, and much larger than it
//   WRING  the furthest a lengthways flick can twist it
//   TOP    the cursor speed that reaches those limits, px per ms — anything
//          faster clamps there
//   SHARP  the half-width of the deformation — this is the "local" knob:
//          small is a tight kink, large is a broad bow
//   RELAX  how long the drag takes to bleed away once the cursor stops, ms
//   CHASE  how long the line takes to catch up to the drag, ms
//   EDGE   how much of each end is pinned, as a fraction of the height
//   STEPS  how many points the line is built from — has to be fine enough to
//          resolve SHARP, or a tight kink comes out as a polygon
//   ROOM   the svg's width, which has to clear PULL + WRING either side

// REACH and PULL are deliberately not in proportion: the cursor has to get
// within 50px to touch the line at all, and can then throw it 200px — four
// times as far as it ever had to be, so the line is routinely flung clean past
// the cursor flinging it. That mismatch is the effect; keep it if these get
